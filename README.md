## 🎯 Objective
To create and evaluate passwords of varying complexity using online password strength checkers, understand the factors that make a password strong, and summarize best practices for password creation and protection against common attacks.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Password Meter – [https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) (for password strength evaluation)

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
- Created multiple sample passwords with different lengths and complexity levels.
- Opened Password Meter ([https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)) in a web browser.
- Entered each password into the tool to evaluate its strength score and feedback.
- Recorded the score, complexity level, and suggestions for improvement from the tool.
- Compared results to identify patterns between password structure and strength.
- Researched best practices for creating strong passwords and common password attacks.

## 🔍 Key Learnings & Best Practices
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns (qwerty, 123456).
- Use passphrases for better memorability (`Blue!Sky$Rises7Fast`).
- Don’t reuse passwords across accounts.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Consider using a password manager to store complex passwords securely.

## 🔄 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Trying every possible combination until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Using precompiled lists of common passwords and words.
- **Credential Stuffing** – Using leaked username/password combos from data breaches.
- **Phishing** – Tricking a user into revealing their password.
