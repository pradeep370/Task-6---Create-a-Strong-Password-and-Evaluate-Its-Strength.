## 🎯 Objective
To create and evaluate passwords of varying complexity using online password strength checkers, understand the factors that make a password strong, and summarize best practices for password creation and protection against common attacks.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Password Meter – [https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) (for password strength evaluation)

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
- Created multiple sample passwords with different lengths and complexity levels.
- Opened Password Meter ([https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)) in a web browser.
- Entered each password into the tool to evaluate its strength score and feedback.
- Recorded the score, complexity level, and suggestions for improvement from the tool.
- Compared results to identify patterns between password structure and strength.
- Researched best practices for creating strong passwords and common password attacks.

## 🔍 Key Learnings & Best Practices
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns (qwerty, 123456).
- Use passphrases for better memorability (`Blue!Sky$Rises7Fast`).
- Don’t reuse passwords across accounts.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Consider using a password manager to store complex passwords securely.

## 🔄 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Trying every possible combination until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Using precompiled lists of common passwords and words.
- **Credential Stuffing** – Using leaked username/password combos from data breaches.
- **Phishing** – Tricking a user into revealing their password.

## 📸 Screenshots
## **123456789**
 - Just digits in sequence — no complexity.
 - Very vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.
 - Avoid completely.

 ## **hazeena2002**
 - Contains a likely personal name + birth year or common number sequence.
 - No uppercase letters or special characters, which lowers complexity.
 - Vulnerable if attacker knows or guesses the personal info.
 - Better than "123456789" but still not strong.

## **B/@ck403@#*Test**
- Mix of uppercase (B, T), lowercase, numbers (403), and several special chars (@, #, *).
- Longer length increases security.
- Complex and unpredictable, much harder to crack.
- Good candidate for a strong password.
